# hello-world
This is my first repository
Hello my name is Brian and I am 26 Y.O. I am in the process of transitioning into the tech industry. I have a M.S. in Biomedical Science and I am trying to get into a graduate program for Software Engineering. I am trying to learn as much as possible on programming and best practices for software development.
